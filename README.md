#### Notes
All samples of code had been writing and tested in BlueJ IDE. For Duke's courses recommended using a [<ins>custom version of BlueJ</ins>](https://www.dukelearntoprogram.com//downloads/bluej.php?course=2).  
I used standart version from [<ins>official website</ins>](https://bluej.org) (at the time of take the course it's a version of 5.0.0).  
Each sample of source code contains a main method with calls test methods.  
Some code use extra packages, these packages are included by default in Duke's custom version of BlueJ, but links just in case:
